Today Apple released the highly talked about iPad. Coming in light (16GB), medium (32GB) and super (64GB) absorbent sizes, it's designed to fit in between the current supporting legs of mobile devices: Smartphones and Laptops.

Ok, I'll stop poking fun at the lame name. Despite the horrible name choice, I am very excited about it, and will definitely be picking one up when they become available. Here's the rest of the important information:

It will be available in 60 days for the WiFi only device, and in 90 days for the 3G enabled version. 3G will be sold directly from the iPad in prepaid chunks with no contract required. 250MB is $14.99, and unlimited is $29.99. Service is provided by AT&T.

It runs a custom 1GHz Apple A4 CPU. Battery life is rated for 10 hours continuous use, and over a month of standby time. The new iPad is .5" thick, weighs 1.5 lbs and boasts a 9.7" IPS display. This display is the same type and quality as used in the MacBook Pro line.

It will run all current iPhone apps, plus developers will have the ability to create specifically for the iPad. Also introduced with the iPad is Apple's entry in the eBook market, the iBooks application, with a dedicated eBook store. Rounding out the package, Apple also showed off the iWork suite running an iPad customized version, available for $10/app at launch.

Pricing starts at $500 for the WiFi 16GB version. 32GB and 64GB versions are $600 and $700, respectively. 3G is available on any size iPad for an additional $130.
