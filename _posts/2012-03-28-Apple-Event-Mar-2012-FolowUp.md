## Follow up to my March Event predictions

I wanted to comment on my predictions and how I fared. Overall, I got it about 70% right, maybe a little more. The “new iPad” (as neither iPad 3 or HD were used) did replace the current iPad 2 at the same price points. It didn’t have an A6, but instead an A5X, featuring the same CPU, but Quad-Core Graphics. The camera was improved as I expected, and we ended up getting LTE, which I thought was possible but not too certain. The big shock is the battery, its just massive: in fact its 70% larger than the iPad 2’s battery.

iPhoto for iOS did come out, even though I thought it’d be called Aperture. It does perform the power features I was hoping for though (and after having used it, its a fantastic app).

I also correctly predicted the iPad 2 would stick around, and at 16GB in size, although Apple kept the price $100 higher than I would have liked to have seen. I still think they missed the boat on this, though with all the talk about a 7.85" iPad on the horizon, they may have purposely left a $299 gap for now (the iPod touch starts at $199, iPad 2 at $399, iPad “HD” at $499).

Spec wise, I was right on the AppleTV, but only half right on the gaming side. However, my original prediction two years ago was that it’d be by holiday season, so there is still time for me to be proven right on that. The new AppleTV does support apps though, and mention of 3rd party apps has been made, so I feel I got this one right overall.

iOS 5.1 was released that day, but that was an easy one. There was no revision to other hardware though, which I admit surprised me. I suspect that we will see a full press conference for the next revision then, as I expect big things from the laptop line and a fairly significant revamp.

All in all, I didn’t do too badly, and I’m quite happy with what did get announced. As Tim Cook stated though, the year is young and they are just getting started. Here’s to 2012. :)
