Ever since the new Apple Silicon chips were announced, I knew i would upgrade to one. I (somewhat) patiently waited for the iMac update, as I wanted to use an iMac as the centerpiece to my new home setup. Unfortunately, when the new M1 powered iMAcs were announced, they still had a fatal flaw that I couldn't ignore: support for only one external monitor. I currently have 2 4k monitors, and had wanted to move to 3 with the iMac screen as the center one.

Today, I was finally able to order my own Apple Silicon device; a Mac Studio with the follwiing specs:

- M1 Max 10-Core CPU / 32-Core GPU
- 64GB Unified Memory
- 2TB SSD

I kinda wish I had sprung for the 4TB version; but I didnâ€™t want to commit to that high of a price right now. Too late to change it anyway since there is now a 3 month back order (mine is due by the end of this month).

Ahhhh! I'm so excited!
